# graphicsFinalProject

Work in teams.
Write a program(s) in WebGL+GLSL+HTML5 that displays an architectural view of a house of your own design. Alternatively, you can use the design of an existing house. Make the program interactive so that the user can walk through the house. The program should include primitives and lighting techniques (e.g. an external light simulating the Sun light, a light from inside the house simulating a lamp, etc.). You should add objects to the house such as chairs, a table, a vase, paintings, etc. The architectural view must include textures. At least two of them should be created using ray-tracing technique (use POV-Ray), so you must also provide the POV-Ray source code used for generating the textures. The POV-Ray programs must be original.
These are some examples of architectural views:

Be creative. You may want to add a skybox, maybe an animation such as a small waterfall for the garden, etc.

The program(s) must be well documented. You will explain your programs and your architectural views on the last day of classes. Each team will have about 10 minutes to do it.

Upload the source code and extra files (e.g. image files) in a zip file to the CMS. Don't forget to add the team members' names to the source code. Please send me an email (miguel.garcia@algomau.ca) if you want early feedback on your project you can also see me during my student office hours (Tue., Wed. 2:30-4pm). You should ask for feedback and early revision at least once before the last day of classes.
Upload one zip file per team.

Rubrics:
WebGL source code: 10%
GLSL and HTML5 code: 10%
POV-Ray source code: 5%
